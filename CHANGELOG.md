# Changelog

All notable changes to `filament-jobs-monitor` will be documented in this file.

## 4.5.1 - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **The bundled stylesheet no longer leaks into the whole application.** It was registered
  with `FilamentAsset::register()` in `packageBooted()`, which is not panel-scoped — so it
  loaded on every page of every panel, including panels that never register this plugin, and
  rendered after the panel theme. Being a plain Tailwind utility dump, its single-class
  selectors then overrode the host application's `ring-*`, `gray-*` and `primary-*` utilities
  app-wide (the bundle hard-codes `primary` to amber, and its Tailwind v3 `--tw-ring-*`
  scheme is incompatible with Tailwind v4 rings).

### Changed

- **BREAKING (styling only):** the bundled stylesheet is now opt-in and panel-scoped via
  `FilamentJobsMonitorPlugin::make()->withStyles()`. Panels with a custom theme should
  instead add this package to their theme's `@source` list, per Filament's
  [plugin Tailwind guidance](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/advanced/assets#using-tailwind-css-in-plugins).
  See the "Styles" section of the README.

## 4.5.0 - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Sentry-style Failures page**: failed jobs are grouped by signature (exception class + job class + normalised message), with a stats overview, per-group 7-day sparklines, Open/Resolved/All tabs, a stack-trace detail slide-over, and actions to resolve/reopen/retry a whole group. Requires the new `add_failures_to_filament-jobs-monitor_table` migration; if it isn't run the plugin keeps working and simply skips grouping. (#119)
- **Dedicated pruning command** `php artisan filament-jobs-monitor:prune`: prunes the package's `QueueMonitor` records directly, since Laravel's `model:prune` only auto-discovers models under `app/Models`. ([@luiseduardobraschi](https://github.com/luiseduardobraschi) — #120)
- **Tenant ID discovery for queued events/listeners**: tenant detection now also covers `CallQueuedListener`, with a configurable `tenancy.payload_key` (default `tenant_id`). ([@zerdotre](https://github.com/zerdotre) — #115)
- **PHP 8.5 support**: added to the Composer constraint, with a Carbon deprecation fixed. ([@BjornKraft](https://github.com/BjornKraft) — #123)

### Fixed

- **Stats widget on SQLite/MySQL**: the execution-time aggregates (total/average) now convert datetimes to epoch seconds per driver (`strftime` on SQLite, `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` on MySQL/MariaDB, `EXTRACT(EPOCH …)` on PostgreSQL) instead of a raw datetime subtraction that returned `0` on SQLite. ([@mokhosh](https://github.com/mokhosh) — #55)
- **N+1 queries in the stats widget**: the per-day counters now run a single query and group in memory, which is also portable across database drivers. ([@webard](https://github.com/webard) — #121)
- **`prunable()` crash when pruning is disabled**: it returned `false`, which broke `pruneAll()` (`Call to a member function when() on false`); it now returns a query that matches nothing (safe no-op). (#120)
- **Duplicate config key**: removed the duplicated `sub_navigation_position` entry. ([@DanielFatkic](https://github.com/DanielFatkic) — #118)

### CI

- Add a `run-tests` workflow running Pest on PHP 8.4 and 8.5. (#125)
- Bump `actions/checkout` from 6 to 7. (#122)

## 4.4.1 - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Details action modal crash**: Fixed `Attempt to read property "exception_message" on null` error when clicking the "Details" action on `QueueMonitorResource`. The closure parameter was renamed from `$queueMonitor` to `$record` to match Filament 5 conventions. ([@danielebarbaro](https://github.com/danielebarbaro) — #111)

### CI

- Bump `dependabot/fetch-metadata` from `3.0.0` to `3.1.0` (#112)
- Fix Dependabot auto-merge workflow: replace `--auto --merge` with `--squash` to work without the auto-merge repository setting

## 4.4.0 - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **`int|string` tenant ID support**: `scopeForTenant()` now accepts both integer and string tenant IDs, enabling compatibility with packages like `tenancyforlaravel` that use string-based UUIDs as tenant identifiers. The PHP payload serialization query has been updated accordingly. ([@zerdotre](https://github.com/zerdotre) — #106)
- **Clear logs button**: New "Clear all logs" header action in the queue monitor table, with a confirmation modal before truncating all records. ([@zerdotre](https://github.com/zerdotre) — #106)
- **Tenant ID column visibility**: The `tenant_id` column is now visible in the table when multi-tenancy is enabled in the config.

### Changed

- Migration stub: `tenant_id` column type changed from `unsignedBigInteger` to `string` (with index). This only affects **new installations** — existing users who need this change should create a new migration to alter the column type.

> **Note for existing multi-tenant users**: If you were using integer-based tenant IDs, the serialization format used in `scopeForTenant()` has changed from PHP integer format (`i:123;`) to PHP string format (`s:3:"123";`). Existing records in the `queue_monitors` table are not affected, but new jobs dispatched with string-typed `$tenantId` will be stored and queried using the string format.
