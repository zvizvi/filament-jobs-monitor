## Installation

Check your filamentPHP version before installing:

| Version | FilamentPHP | PHP     |
| ------- | ----------- |---------|
| 1.*     | 2.*         | 8.1     |
| 2.*     | 3.*         | \>= 8.1 |
| 3.*     | 4.*         | \>= 8.1 |
| 4.*     | 5.*         | \>= 8.2 |


Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require croustibat/filament-jobs-monitor
```

Publish and run the migrations using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-jobs-monitor-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

### Styles

This package's views are styled with Tailwind utility classes. As of v4.5.1 the bundled
stylesheet is **not** loaded automatically — you choose how those classes get compiled.

**If your panel has a [custom theme](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/styling/overview#creating-a-custom-theme) (recommended)**, add this package to the theme's
`@source` list so the utilities are built with *your* design tokens:

```css
/* resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css */
@source '../../../../vendor/croustibat/filament-jobs-monitor/resources/views/**/*.blade.php';
@source '../../../../vendor/croustibat/filament-jobs-monitor/src/**/*.php';
```

**If your panel uses Filament's default stylesheet**, opt into the bundled build instead:

```php
FilamentJobsMonitorPlugin::make()->withStyles()
```

> [!WARNING]
> Earlier versions registered the bundled stylesheet globally from the service provider.
> Because `FilamentAsset::register()` is not panel-scoped, it loaded on every page of
> **every** panel — including panels that never register this plugin — and rendered after
> the panel theme. Its plain utility selectors then overrode the host application's
> `ring-*`, `gray-*` and `primary-*` classes app-wide (the bundle hard-codes `primary` to
> amber). `withStyles()` now scopes it to the panel it is registered on, and it is off by
> default. See [Using Tailwind CSS in plugins](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/advanced/assets#using-tailwind-css-in-plugins).

## Usage

### Configuration

The global plugin config can be published using the command below:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-jobs-monitor-config"
```

This is the content of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'resources' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'label' => 'Job',
        'plural_label' => 'Jobs',
        'navigation_group' => 'Settings',
        'navigation_icon' => 'heroicon-o-cpu-chip',
        'navigation_sort' => null,
        'navigation_count_badge' => false,
        'resource' => Croustibat\FilamentJobsMonitor\Resources\QueueMonitorResource::class,
        'cluster' => null,
        'sub_navigation_position' => null, // SubNavigationPosition::Top or ::Sidebar
    ],
    'failures' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'polling_interval' => '10s',
    ],
    'pruning' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'retention_days' => 7,
    ],
    'queues' => [
        'default'
    ],
    'tenancy' => [
        'enabled' => false,
        'model' => null, // e.g., App\Models\Tenant::class
        'column' => 'tenant_id',
    ],
];
```

**NOTE:** Since there isn't a universal way to retrieve all used queues, it's necessary to define them to obtain all pending jobs. 

### Failures page

The **Failures** page groups failed jobs by signature — exception class, job class and normalised message (dynamic values such as ids, uuids and quoted strings are stripped) — so a thousand occurrences of the same error show up as a single row instead of a thousand, Sentry-style.

It includes:

- A stats overview: open groups, failures in the last hour, 24h failure rate and groups resolved in the last 7 days.
- A table of failure groups with occurrence counts, last-seen time and a 7-day sparkline per group, with **Open / Resolved / All** tabs and filters by exception class and queue.
- A detail slide-over per group with the stack trace of the last occurrence (app frames / all frames / raw toggle), the failed job payload rendered as a collapsible tree, and the most recent occurrences.
- Actions to **mark a group resolved** (a new occurrence reopens it automatically), **reopen** it, or **retry all failed jobs** of the group.

The page can be disabled with `'failures' => ['enabled' => false]`. Failure grouping requires the `add_failures_to_filament-jobs-monitor_table` migration — republish the migrations, migrate and publish the plugin assets when upgrading:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-jobs-monitor-migrations"
php artisan migrate
php artisan filament:assets
```

If the migration has not been run, the plugin keeps working as before and simply skips failure grouping.

### Pruning old records

The `QueueMonitor` model uses Laravel's [`Prunable`](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#pruning-models) trait and will prune records older than `pruning.retention_days` (default: 7 days) when `pruning.enabled` is `true`.

> **Important:** Laravel's built-in `php artisan model:prune` command only **auto-discovers** prunable models that live in your application's `app/Models` directory. Because `QueueMonitor` is shipped inside this package (`vendor/...`), it is **never** picked up by a bare `model:prune` call — this is the most common cause of "the model is not pruning".

You have two ways to prune the records:

**1. Use the dedicated command shipped with this package (recommended):**

```bash
php artisan filament-jobs-monitor:prune
```

This targets the package model directly, so it works regardless of your app structure. Schedule it in `routes/console.php` (Laravel 11+) or `app/Console/Kernel.php`:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('filament-jobs-monitor:prune')->daily();
```

**2. Or call Laravel's `model:prune` with an explicit `--model` flag:**

```bash
php artisan model:prune --model="Croustibat\FilamentJobsMonitor\Models\QueueMonitor"
```

Pruning can also be toggled/configured at the plugin level:

```php
FilamentJobsMonitorPlugin::make()
    ->enablePruning() // or ->enablePruning(false) to disable
    ->pruningRetention(14); // keep records for 14 days
```

### Extending Model

Sometimes it's useful to extend the model to add some custom methods. You can do it by extending the model by creating your own model :

```php 
$ php artisan make:model MyQueueMonitor
```

Then you can extend the model by adding your own methods :

```php

    <?php

    namespace App\Models;

    use \Croustibat\FilamentJobsMonitor\Models\QueueMonitor as CroustibatQueueMonitor;

    class MyQueueMonitor extends CroustibatQueueMonitor {}

```

### Multi-Tenancy Support

This plugin supports multi-tenancy for applications using Filament's built-in tenant functionality. When enabled, job monitors are automatically filtered by the current tenant.

**Features:**
- Automatically associates jobs with tenants based on a `tenantId` property in your job class
- Filters the job monitor list to show only jobs for the current tenant
- Filters pending jobs and failed jobs by tenant (via payload inspection)
- Backwards compatible - disabled by default

**Configuration:**

Enable multi-tenancy in your published config file:

```php
'tenancy' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'model' => App\Models\Tenant::class,  // Your tenant model
    'column' => 'tenant_id',              // Column name in queue_monitors table
],
```

**Migration:**

If you enable tenancy after initial installation, re-publish and run the migration to add the `tenant_id` column:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-jobs-monitor-migrations" --force
php artisan migrate
```

**Job Requirements:**

For jobs to be associated with a tenant, they must have a public `tenantId` property:

```php
class MyTenantJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public function __construct(
        public int|string $tenantId,  // Required for multi-tenancy
        // ... other properties
    ) {}
}
```

When dispatching the job, pass the current tenant ID:

```php
MyTenantJob::dispatch(
    tenantId: Filament::getTenant()->id,
    // ... other arguments
);
```

See [examples/TenantAwareExportJob.php](./examples/TenantAwareExportJob.php) for a complete example.

### Using Filament Panels

If you are using Filament Panels, you can register the Plugin to your Panel configuration. This will register the plugin's resources as well as allow you to set configuration using optional chainable methods.

For example in your `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php` file:

```php
<?php


use \Croustibat\FilamentJobsMonitor\FilamentJobsMonitorPlugin;

...

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugins([
            FilamentJobsMonitorPlugin::make()
        ]);
}
```

## Usage

Just run a Background Job and go to the route `/admin/queue-monitors` to see the jobs.

## Example

Go to [example](./examples/) folder to see a Job example file.

Then you can call your Job with the following code:

```php
    public static function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table

        // rest of your code
        ...

        ->bulkActions([
            BulkAction::make('export-jobs')
            ->label('Background Export')
            ->icon('heroicon-o-cog')
            ->action(function (Collection $records) {
                UsersCsvExportJob::dispatch($records, 'users.csv');
                Notification::make()
                    ->title('Export is ready')
                    ->body('Your export is ready. You can download it from the exports page.')
                    ->success()
                    ->seconds(5)
                    ->icon('heroicon-o-inbox-in')
                    ->send();
            })
        ])
    }
```

### Enabling navigation


````php
        // AdminPanelProvider.php
        ->plugins([
            // ...
            FilamentJobsMonitorPlugin::make()
                ->enableNavigation(),
        ])
````

Or you can use a closure to enable navigation only for specific users:

```php

        // AdminPanelProvider.php
        ->plugins([
            // ...
            FilamentJobsMonitorPlugin::make()
                ->enableNavigation(
                    fn () => auth()->user()->can('view_queue_job') || auth()->user()->can('view_any_queue_job)'),
                ),
        ])
```
